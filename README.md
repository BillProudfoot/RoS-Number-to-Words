**Number To Words**

**Task:**

Write a piece of code that takes an integer expressed in digits and returns it in __British__ English words:
 
Input / output
- 1 = one
- 21 = twenty one
- 105 = one hundred and five
- 56945781 = fifty six million nine hundred and forty five thousand seven hundred and eighty one

Up to 999,999,999 without any external libraries, except testing libraries.
  
Please provide a console-based application that can be built or integrated easily and without dependencies on external systems. Make it clear in documentation how to use the feature practically. 

Your application should accept input from stdin and emit responses to stdout. Conversion errors should respond with the word __"invalid"__ for our testing purposes.

The language you choose is up to you, however we have provided a basic Java harness for you to expand on. Java, Python and Javascript are the languages mainly used in Registers of Scotland.

Don't be limited by our spec: If you would prefer another language please make it clear which language and version you are using. If you have a better approach then show it. Be aware that it might take us longer to assess your work and invite you in, and our conversation might be shallower and wider.

You should expect to spend no more than a couple of hours on this task. Your product should be representative of the kind and quality of work you would expect to complete in Registers of Scotland if you had the same time pressure.
 
Please don't share this puzzle with other people or publish it out in the world – thank you.
 
Practical considerations: Supply your code in a zip and send it to devrecruitment@ros.gov.uk with “exercise solution” in the subject line, and we’ll reply with a confirmation that we’ve received it.
